# FakeOS: Windows 98

This is a fake desktop operating system inspired by Windows 98.

## How To Use

This app should be viewed on a desktop sized screen to get the best experience

### Start Menu

To show a non-functional start menu featuring icons and hover effects, clicking the start button in the bottom left corner.

When the start menu opens, the start button styling will update to show that it has been clicked. If an app modal is open, it will close.

To hide the menu and restore the start button to its original state, click the start button again.

### Time

The clock in the bottom right corner shows the local time in Melbourne. While using 24-time makes the AM/PM label redundant, the label has been included to reference the Windows 98 reference image.

### App Modals

To open an app, click on its corresponding button in the top left corner. Unlike in the real Window 98 OS, the app buttons have been styled with grey backgrounds, borders and navy text to make them stand out from the background image.

The app will open in a modal. When this happens, any already opened app modal will close. The start menu will hide if it's showing.

To close an app, click the x button in its top right corner.

## App Functionality

### Greetings

When Greetings is opened, it selects and displays a random greeting. The options are "Hello There!" (yes, that's a Star Wars prequel reference), "Bonjour!", "Hola!" and "Hey, what's up?"

### Number Guess

When Number Guess is opened, it selects a number between 0 and 9. To guess the number, enter a value in the input and click the submit button.

A message will be displayed to inform the user of whether they've selected the collect number. The user may make as many guess as they like. The correct number will remain the same until the app is closed and reopened.

### Image Gallery

The Image Gallery app elegantly displays a grid of attractive seasonal images.
